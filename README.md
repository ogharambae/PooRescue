## üí° INSPIRATION üí°
Imagine yourself driving back home, and all of a sudden you need to quickly use the washroom. Your house is 20 minutes away, WHAT DO YOU DO?? Today there is an ongoing problem where there is not a reliable source of information for easy to access public washrooms. On top of multitude of bowel health problems, including IBS, Lactose Intolerance, and even COVID. 

Did you know there are up to 1 in 4 women who have dealt with Fecal Incontinence. Furthermore, 30% of Americans with disabilities have trouble searching for accessible washrooms.
There is a large number of groups across the world that risk defecating themselves, and that is where PooRescue comes in!

## ‚öôÔ∏è WHAT IT DOES ‚öôÔ∏è
PooRescue lists out all the locations and detailed information of local washrooms. Pre-populated first with the city's public datasets of Public Washrooms, and as well as users being able to add undiscovered locations. Users will be able to filter through a wealth of information, such as which washrooms are 24/7, which washrooms have caretakers, and also which ones are accessible for the disabled.

## üõ†Ô∏è HOW WE BUILT ITüõ†Ô∏è
For the frontend, we used React(JS)/MUI and FramerMotion to create a visual and accessible way for users to quickly find washrooms. As well as fluid API calls for the Google Maps API and our custom RESTAPI.

For our data, we are using a noSQL database called MongoDB. We initialized the population of washrooms with the city's public dataset of washrooms and hope to have users add further data themselves.

For the backend, we used Express and Node.js to create a RESTAPI where user authentication is enabled using jwt tokens and also CRUD operations to our database.

## üò£  CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO üò£
It was challenging for us to architecturally set up our whole functioning app within 24 hours especially since it was both our first time using Google Maps API.

## üéâ ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE ARE PROUD OF üéâ
We are proud to have overcome the challenging 24 hours that was thrown at us. Especially with the fact that we developed a fully functioning app that we had hoped to intend it to be!

## ‚è≠Ô∏è WHAT'S NEXT FOR PooRescue ‚è≠Ô∏è
This has been our long awaited passion project, and we hope to continue working on this app. Although we have a dataset only limited to our city in Vancouver, we hope one day to have users globally across the world use this application to help EVERYONE! Furthermore we hope the custom API and dataset we have built will come into use for other developers or medical professionals to use!
